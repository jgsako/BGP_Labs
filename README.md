# BGP_Labs.zip Virtual Images
Linked is a compressed .zip archive named BGP_Labs.zip that contains images for deploying Ubuntu 20.04 VM's with BGP Attack labs and exercises that have been sourced from SeedLabs and Mininet which demonstrate attacking, and mitigations of attacks, on a self-made BGP network<br/>

</br></br>
There are multiple virtualization file types inside the BGP_Labs.zip which has two folders:<br/>
**Proxmox**</br>
**VSphere**</br>
</br>
There are slightly different steps that need to be taken to import the OVF & VMDK into VSphere compared to ESXI. Proxmox has, all together, different steps that involve downloading the .qcow2 file, from the Proxmox folder, and transferring it directly to the Proxmox instance where it can be imported.
</br></br>

Each folder contains an Ubuntu 20.04 VM image that is configured to SeedLabs specifications: </br>https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/blob/master/manuals/vm/seedvm-from-scratch.md
</br></br></br>
The labs that will be included in both the image files are as follows: </br>
**Mininet Basic Lab** <br/>
**SeedLabs BGP_Basic Lab** <br/>
**SeedLabs BGP_Advanced Lab** <br/>
</br></br>
